# Clear All Transforms
Blender add-on for clearing all transforms in object mode.
Because oddly enough that's something you couldn't do before.

## Installation
1. Download **clear_all.py** from the [latest release](https://github.com/benthillerkus/clear_all/releases)
2. In Blender:
  1. Go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install`
  2. Select your downloaded script
  3. Click *Install Add-on*
  4. Make sure you have the box next to *Object: Clear All Transforms* clicked.
  
Feel free to delete the script now. Blender already copied it into its add-ons folder.

## Usage

You can either use the menu entry or just use the shortcut Alt + T. You can also reset the transformations of multiple items.
In the F6-menu (the small collapsed one in the bottom left of your 3D-viewport) you can choose to only reset some parameters or to also reset the delta transformations.

Internally the add-on calls the individual operators behind `Alt + G`, `Alt + S` and `Alt + R`. You can find their documentation [in the official manual](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/object/editing/clear.html).
While you're there, look at the [Clear Transform operator](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/armatures/posing/editing/clear.html) in pose mode or the [Apply operator](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/object/editing/apply.html) and wonder why this was missed for clearing transforms in object mode ðŸ¤”

## Settings
You can uncheck *Use default shortcut (Alt + T)* if you don't want to have the add-on set this default shortcut.

### Setting a custom shortcut
If you aren't happy with the default shortcut, you can set a custom shortcut.
The operator you want to set the shortcut for is `object.transforms_clear`.
